        Whilst we understand that for many people online gaming is a hobby and
        provides a form of great entertainment, gambling can also lead to some
        players becoming addicted and thus using our services to fuel their
        addiction.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
        To ensure that you are gambling responsibly, we suggest the following
        guidelines:
      </h2>

      <ul className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-100 mb-8">
        <li>
          Do not gamble if you are recovering from a dependency or if you are
          under the influence of alcohol or any other substance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Give yourself a set amount of playing time and limit yourself to this
          time, win or lose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not rely on gambling as a source of income or to chase your losses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not let gambling interfere with other aspects of your daily life.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set yourself limits within your means, for both purchasing and losses
          before you begin.
        </li>
      </ul>
